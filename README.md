`meta-vulnscout` is a Yocto meta-layer that uses `vulnscout` to scan a project, export its Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), and list the vulnerabilities that affect it.
Support for Cyclone DX, SPDX, Yocto JSON files, and Open VEX.

## Prerequisites

The command `docker-compose` or `docker compose` should be available on the host device.

## Requirements

This layer, named `meta-vulnscout`, requires your project to be built with the generation of an SBOM and a CVE report.

If this is not the case yet, you can simply add the following to `build/conf/local.conf`:

```shell
INHERIT += "cve-check"
include conf/distro/include/cve-extra-exclusions.inc
```

You may also need to add `INHERIT += "create-spdx"` if you are not using the default `poky` distro and if your used distro doesn't inherit it already.

Also, for a faster NVD database downloading during vulnscout setup, you can set a NVD key with the variable `NVDCVE_API_KEY`.

Yocto Documentation reference : https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/variables.html#term-NVDCVE_API_KEY

You can generate a new NVD key at :  https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key

##  Installation

To install this meta-layer, simply clone the repository into the `sources` directory and add it to your `build/conf/bblayers.conf` file:

```shell
$ cd sources
$ git clone https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/meta-vulnscout.git
```
And in your `bblayers.conf` file:

```shell
BBLAYERS += "/path/to/meta-vulnscout"
```

## Configuration

To enable and configure Vulnscout, you simply add `inherit vulnscout` in your image recipe.

This project contains an example as described in `recipes-core/images/core-image-minimal.bbappend`.

## Building

You can build your image as you normally would.

As a result, you should see a new `.vulnscout` folder in `${TOPDIR}/..` (can be modified with variable `VULNSCOUT_ROOT_DIR`).

The scan and analysis of vulnerabilities can start with the yocto command:

```shell
bitbake core-image-minimal -c vulnscout
```

Or you can do it manually with the command:

```shell
docker compose -f "<project_root>/.vulnscout/core-image-minimal/docker-compose.yml" up
```

Without a custom configuration, a web interface will be started at the address `http://localhost:7275`.

## Launching Vulnscout in CI mode

It is possible to launch Vulnscout in a CI mode, without the web interface.
To launch `vulnscout` in a CI mode, use this command:
```bash
bitbake core-image-minimal -c vulnscout_ci
```
All the files generated by `vulnscout` will be placed by default here: *<project_root>/.vulnscout/core-image-minimal/output*

**Options**\
`vulnscout` in CI mode can be launched with a specific `fail condition` using an environment variable.

First you need to export the environment variable `BB_ENV_PASSTHROUGH="VULS_FAIL_CONDITION"`\
Either way, by using the `export` command:

```bash
export BB_ENV_PASSTHROUGH="VULS_FAIL_CONDITION"
```
Or every time you launch `vulnscout` in the CI mode:

```bash
BB_ENV_PASSTHROUGH="VULS_FAIL_CONDITION" bitbake core-image-minimal -c vulnscout_ci
```
Now you can precise the fail condition with the `VULS_FAIL_CONDITION` variable every time you use `vulnscout` in CI mode:

```bash
VULS_FAIL_CONDITION="cvss >= 9.0" BB_ENV_PASSTHROUGH="VULS_FAIL_CONDITION" bitbake core-image-minimal -c vulnscout_ci
```
With this command, `vulnscout` will list all the CVEs of the vulnerabilities with a CVSS score equal to or higher than 9.0.

It's possible to set more than one condition:

```bash
VULS_FAIL_CONDITION="cvss >= 9.0 or (cvss >= 7.0 and epss >= 50%)" bitbake core-image-minimal -c vulnscout_ci
```
With this command, `vulnscout` will list all vulnerabilities critical (CVSS >= 9.0) or those with both a high CVSS and EPSS score.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting up the fail condition this way will overload the "VULNSCOUT_ENV_FAIL_CONDITION" variable in the *vulnscout.bbclass*

> [!WARNING]
> If you set the "VULS_FAIL_CONDITION" with the `export` command in your shell, it will always uses it until you set it to null
